Zippity is the easiest way to handle zip files on your iPhone. It can open
zip files received in emails or downloaded from the web, allowing you to
preview the contents, forward them by email and so on.

and tap on the file attachment to open in Zippity. If you've browsed to a Zip
file on the web, tap the "Open in..." button at the top of the Safari window
