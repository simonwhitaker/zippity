# Zippity iOS 7 TODOs

## UI

**Note: in all cases, retain existing behaviour for iOS 6.**

- [ ] Unify tintColor for nav bars. (Currently file list view is red, others are gray, still others, e.g. image viewer, are default)
- [ ] Redesign About view
- [ ] New icon
- [ ] Hide separators between empty table rows (see `UITableView`'s `separatorInset`, but how? Docs incomplete.)
- [ ] Dropbox progress view: assess look and feel under iOS 7. (Might need to remove drop shadow at top of view?)
- [x] New GSDropboxActivity icon
- [ ] Check GSDropboxDestinationSelectionViewController (e.g. tintColor: is it still appropriate?)
- [x] Remove background images from nav bar and info view if on iOS 7

## Other

- [ ] Crash on exiting image viewer
